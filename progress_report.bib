abstract = {Mean phase space tendencies are investigated to systematically identify the origin of nonlinear signatures and the dynamical sigificance of small deviations from Gaussianity of planetary low-frequency waves. A general framework for the systematic investigation of mean phase space tendencies in complex geophysical systems is derived. In the special case of purely Gaussian statistics, this theory predicts that the interactions among the planetary waves themselves are the source of the nonlinear signatures in phase space, whereas the unresolved waves contribute only an amplitude-independent forcing, and cannot contribute to any nonlinear signature. The predictions of the general framework are studied for a simple stochastic climate model. This toy model has statistics that are very close to being Gaussian and a strong nonlinear signature in the form of a double swirl in the mean phase space tendencies of its low-frequency variables, much like recently identified signatures of nonlinear planetary wave dynamics in prototype and comprehensive atmospheric general circulation models (GCMs). As predicted by the general framework for the Gaussian case, the double swirl results from nonlinear interactions of the low-frequency variables. Mean phase space tendencies in a reduced space of a prototype atmospheric GCM are also investigated. Analysis of the dynamics producing nonlinear signatures in these mean tendencies shows a complex interplay between waves resolved in the subspace and unresolved waves. The interactions among the resolved planetary waves themselves do not produce the nonlinear signature. It is the interaction with the unresolved waves that is responsible for the nonlinear dynamics. Comparing this result with the predictions of the general framework for the Gaussian case shows that the impact of the unresolved waves is due to their small deviations from Gaussianity. This suggests that the observed deviations from Gaussianity, even though small, are dynamically relevant. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {Local bifurcations of stationary points and limit cycles have successfully been characterized in terms of the critical exponents of these solutions. Lyapunov exponents and their associated covariant Lyapunov vectors have been proposed as tools for supporting the understanding of critical transitions in chaotic dynamical systems. However, it is in general not clear how the statistical properties of dynamical systems change across a boundary crisis during which a chaotic attractor collides with a saddle. This behavior is investigated here for a boundary crisis in the Lorenz flow, for which neither the Lyapunov exponents nor the covariant Lyapunov vectors provide a criterion for the crisis. Instead, the convergence of the time evolution of probability densities to the invariant measure, governed by the semigroup of transfer operators, is expected to slow down at the approach of the crisis. Such convergence is described by the eigenvalues of the generator of this semigroup, which can be divided into two families, referred to as the stable and unstable Ruelle–Pollicott resonances, respectively. The former describes the convergence of densities to the attractor (or escape from a repeller) and is estimated from many short time series sampling the state space. The latter is responsible for the decay of correlations, or mixing, and can be estimated from a long times series, invoking ergodicity. It is found numerically for the Lorenz flow that the stable resonances do approach the imaginary axis during the crisis, as is indicative of the loss of global stability of the attractor. On the other hand, the unstable resonances, and a fortiori the decay of correlations, do not flag the proximity of the crisis, thus questioning the usual design of early warning indicators of boundary crises of chaotic attractors and the applicability of response theory close to such crises.},

abstract = {Abstract. The climate system can been described by a dynamical system and its associated attractor. The dynamics of this attractor depends on the external forcings that influence the climate. Such forcings can affect the mean values or variances, but regions of the attractor that are seldom visited can also be affected. It is an important challenge to measure how the climate attractor responds to different forcings. Currently, the Euclidean distance or similar measures like the Mahalanobis distance have been favored to measure discrepancies between two climatic situations. Those distances do not have a natural building mechanism to take into account the attractor dynamics. In this paper, we argue that a Wasserstein distance, stemming from optimal transport theory, offers an efficient and practical way to discriminate between dynamical systems. After treating a toy example, we explore how the Wasserstein distance can be applied and interpreted to detect non-autonomous dynamics from a Lorenz system driven by seasonal cycles and a warming trend.},

A natural separation of phase-space into an invariant set and its complement allows for an analytical derivation of the different terms involved in the parametrization, namely the average, fluctuation and long memory terms. In this case, the fluctuation term consists of additive stochastic noise. Its application to the low-order system reveals that a considerable correction of the low-frequency variability along the invariant subset can be obtained, provided that the coupling is sufficiently weak.

Using a modified version of the two-level Lorenz '96 model, we present here a proof of concept of a scale-adaptive parametrization constructed using statistical mechanical arguments. By suitable use of the Ruelle response theory and the Mori–Zwanzig projection method, it is possible to derive explicitly a parametrization for the fast variables that translates into deterministic, stochastic and non-Markovian extra terms in the equations of motion for the variables of interest. We show that our approach is computationally parsimonious and has great flexibility, as it is explicitly scale-adaptive, and we prove that it is competitive compared with empirical ad-hoc approaches. While the parametrization proposed here is universal and can easily be adapted analytically to changes in parameter values by a simple rescaling procedure, the parametrization constructed with the ad-hoc approach needs to be recomputed each time the parameters of the systems are changed. The price we pay for the higher flexibility of the method proposed here is having a lower accuracy in each individual case.},

We show here that such surrogate dynamics agree up to second order to an expansion of the Mori-Zwanzig projected dynamics.

abstract = {Predictive models are constructed to best describe an observed field's statistics within a given class of nonlinear dynamics driven by a spatially coherent noise that is white in time. For linear dynamics, such inverse stochastic models are obtained by multiple linear regression (MLR). Nonlinear dynamics, when more appropriate, is accommodated by applying multiple polynomial regression (MPR) instead; the resulting model uses polynomial predictors, but the dependence on the regression parameters is linear in both MPR and MLR. The basic concepts are illustrated using the Lorenz convection model, the classical double-well problem, and a three-well problem in two space dimensions. Given a data sample that is long enough, MPR successfully reconstructs the model coefficients in the former two cases, while the resulting inverse model captures the three-regime structure of the system's probability density function (PDF) in the latter case. A novel multilevel generalization of the classic regression procedure is introduced next. In this generalization, the residual stochastic forcing at a given level is subsequently modeled as a function of variables at this level and all the preceding ones. The number of levels is determined so that the lag-0 covariance of the residual forcing converges to a constant matrix, while its lag-1 covariance vanishes. This method has been applied to the output of a three-layer, quasigeostrophic model and to the analysis of Northern Hemisphere wintertime geopotential height anomalies. In both cases, the inverse model simulations reproduce well the multiregime structure of the PDF constructed in the subspace spanned by the dataset's leading empirical orthogonal functions, as well as the detailed spectrum of the dataset's temporal evolution. These encouraging results are interpreted in terms of the modeled low-frequency flow's feedback on the statistics of the subgrid-scale processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = {A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic systems is introduced. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived. These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD. It is then shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V. These reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from series. When the sampling rate (in time) at which the observations are collected is either sufficiently small or large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the RP resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the timescale separation is weak. The companions articles, Part II[TCND19a] and Part III [TCND19b], deal with further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics that RP resonances offer. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a clear signature in terms of the geometric organization of the RP resonances in the left half plane. This analysis provides thus an unambiguous signature of nonlinear oscillations contained in a noisy signal and that can be extracted from time series. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances presented in this contribution, Part III addresses then the question of detection and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic system, namely the Cane-Zebiak model of El Ni{\{}$\backslash${\~{}}n{\}}o-Southern Oscillation subject to noise modeling fast atmospheric fluctuations.},

abstract = {This paper has two interrelated foci: (i) obtaining stable and efficient data-driven closure models by using a multivariate time series of partial observations from a large-dimensional system; and (ii) comparing these closure models with the optimal closures predicted by the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism of statistical physics. Multilayer stochastic models (MSMs) are introduced as both a generalization and a time-continuous limit of existing multilevel, regression-based approaches to closure in a data-driven setting; these approaches include empirical model reduction (EMR), as well as more recent multi-layer modeling. It is shown that the multilayer structure of MSMs can provide a natural Markov approximation to the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) of the MZ formalism. A simple correlation-based stopping criterion for an EMR-MSM model is derived to assess how well it approximates the GLE solution. Sufficient conditions are derived on the structure of the nonlinear cross-interactions between the constitutive layers of a given MSM to guarantee the existence of a global random attractor. This existence ensures that no blow-up can occur for a broad class of MSM applications, a class that includes non-polynomial predictors and nonlinearities that do not necessarily preserve quadratic energy invariants. The EMR-MSM methodology is first applied to a conceptual, nonlinear, stochastic climate model of coupled slow and fast variables, in which only slow variables are observed. It is shown that the resulting closure model with energy-conserving nonlinearities efficiently captures the main statistical features of the slow variables, even when there is no formal scale separation and the fast variables are quite energetic. Second, an MSM is shown to successfully reproduce the statistics of a partially observed, generalized Lotka-Volterra model of population dynamics in its chaotic regime. The challenges here include the rarity of strange attractors in the model's parameter space and the existence of multiple attractor basins with fractal boundaries. The positivity constraint on the solutions' components replaces here the quadratic-energy-preserving constraint of fluid-flow problems and it successfully prevents blow-up.},

abstract = {Predicting the response of a system to perturbations is a key challenge in mathematical and natural sciences. Under suitable conditions on the nature of the system, of the perturbation, and of the observables of interest, response theories allow to construct operators describing the smooth change of the invariant measure of the system of interest as a function of the small parameter controlling the intensity of the perturbation. In particular, response theories can be developed both for stochastic and chaotic deterministic dynamical systems, where in the latter case stricter conditions imposing some degree of structural stability are required. In this paper we extend previous fndings and derive general response formulae describing how n-point correlations are affected by perturbations to the vector flow. We also show how to compute the response of the spectral properties of the system to perturbations. We then apply our results to the seemingly unrelated problem of coarse graining in multiscale systems: we fnd explicit formulae describing the change in the terms describing the parameterisation of the neglected degrees of freedom resulting from applying perturbations to the full system. All the terms envisioned by the Mori-Zwanzig theory the deterministic, stochastic, and non-Markovian terms are affected at frst order in the perturbation. The obtained results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the response of statistical mechanical systems to perturbations. They also contribute to the goal of constructing accurate and robust parameterisations and are of potential relevance for felds like molecular dynamics, condensed matter, and geophysical fluid dynamics. We envision possible applications of our general results to the study of the response of climate variability to anthropogenic and natural forcing and to the study of the equivalence of thermostatted statistical mechanical systems.},

We consider here the simple yet paradigmatic case of a Lorenz 84 model forced by a Lorenz 63 model and derive a parametrization using a recently developed statistical mechanical methodology based on the Ruelle response theory. We derive an expression for the deterministic and the stochastic component of the parametrization and we show that the approach allows for dealing seamlessly with the case of the Lorenz 63 being a fast as well as a slow forcing compared to the characteristic timescales of the Lorenz 84 model. We test our results using both standard metrics based on the moments of the variables of interest as well as Wasserstein distance between the projected measure of the original system on the Lorenz 84 model variables and the measure of the parametrized one. By testing our methods on reduced-phase spaces obtained by projection, we find support for the idea that comparisons based on the Wasserstein distance might be of relevance in many applications despite the curse of dimensionality.},

abstract = {We consider two weakly coupled systems and adopt a perturbative approach based on the Ruelle response theory to study their interaction. We propose a systematic way of parameterizing the effect of the coupling as a function of only the variables of a system of interest. Our focus is on describing the impacts of the coupling on the long term statistics rather than on the finite-time behavior. By direct calculation, we find that, at first order, the coupling can be surrogated by adding a deterministic perturbation to the autonomous dynamics of the system of interest. At second order, there are additionally two separate and very different contributions. One is a term taking into account the second-order contributions of the fluctuations in the coupling, which can be parameterized as a stochastic forcing with given spectral properties. The other one is a memory term, coupling the system of interest to its previous history, through the correlations of the second system. If these correlations are known, this effect can be implemented as a perturbation with memory on the single system. In order to treat this case, we present an extension to Ruelle's response theory able to deal with integral operators. We discuss our results in the context of other methods previously proposed for disentangling the dynamics of two coupled systems. We emphasize that our results do not rely on assuming a time scale separation, and, if such a separation exists, can be used equally well to study the statistics of the slow variables and that of the fast variables. By recursively applying the technique proposed here, we can treat the general case of multi-level systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.},
